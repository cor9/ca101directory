## 🔧 COMPREHENSIVE FIX IMPLEMENTED

### ✅ 1. PLAN-BASED VISIBILITY LOGIC
**File:** `src/app/(website)/(public)/listing/[slug]/page.tsx`

**Before (Problematic):**
```tsx
{listing.who_is_it_for && (
  <div className="mb-6">
    <h3>Who Is It For</h3>
    <RichTextDisplay content={listing.who_is_it_for} />
  </div>
)}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```tsx
{/* Premium content - only show for paid plans */}
{listing.who_is_it_for && (listing.plan !== "Free" && listing.plan !== "free") && (
  <div className="mb-6">
    <h3>Who Is It For</h3>
    <RichTextDisplay content={listing.who_is_it_for} />
  </div>
)}
```

### ✅ 2. AFFECTED CONTENT SECTIONS
Applied plan-based visibility to:
- **"Who Is It For"** section
- **"What Makes This Unique"** section  
- **"Service Format"** section
- **"Additional Notes"** section

### ✅ 3. UPGRADE PROMPT FOR FREE LISTINGS
Added attractive upgrade prompt for free listings:

```tsx
{/* Free plan upgrade prompt */}
{(listing.plan === "Free" || listing.plan === "free") && (
  <div className="mt-6 p-4 bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-50 to-yellow-50 border border-orange-200 rounded-lg">
    <div className="flex items-center gap-3 mb-2">
      <span className="text-2xl">📈</span>
      <h3 className="font-semibold text-orange-800">More Details Available</h3>
    </div>
    <p className="text-sm text-orange-700 mb-3">
      This professional has additional details about their services, target audience, and unique approach available with a premium listing.
    </p>
    <div className="flex gap-2">
      <a href="/pricing" className="btn-primary">View Pricing Plans</a>
      <a href="/plan-selection" className="btn-secondary">Upgrade Listing</a>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```
