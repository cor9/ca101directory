# Region Field Migration - Multi-Select Service Areas

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - All Tests Passing  
**Breaking Change:** Yes (database schema changed)

---

## üéØ WHAT CHANGED

### Before:
```
Region: Single dropdown
- Vendor picks ONE region
- "Los Angeles" or "New York" or "Atlanta"
```

### After:
```
Service Areas: Multiple checkboxes
- Vendor picks MULTIPLE regions
- ["West Coast", "Southwest", "Global (Online Only)"]
```

---

## üí° WHY THE CHANGE

**Problem:** Region was too limiting
- LA coach who serves online couldn't show in both
- Hybrid businesses couldn't indicate full service area
- Parents couldn't find virtual coaches in their region filter

**Solution:** Multi-select regions
- Vendors choose WHERE THEY SERVE (not just where they're located)
- City/State = physical location
- Regions = service coverage

**Example:**
```
Business: "ABC Acting Coach"
Location: Los Angeles, CA (single)
Serves: West Coast, Southwest, Global (Online Only) (multiple!)
```

## üó∫Ô∏è NEW REGION OPTIONS

**10 Industry-Aligned Regions:**

| Region | Cities/Areas Covered |
|--------|---------------------|
| West Coast | LA, San Francisco, San Diego, Seattle, Portland |
| Southwest | Albuquerque, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Austin, Dallas |
| Southeast | Atlanta, Miami, Orlando, Charlotte, New Orleans, Nashville |
| Midwest | Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Minneapolis |
| Northeast | New York, Boston, Philadelphia |
| Mid-Atlantic | Washington DC, Baltimore |
| Pacific Northwest | Seattle, Portland |
| Rocky Mountain | Denver, Salt Lake City |
| Canada | Vancouver, Toronto |
| Global (Online Only) | Virtual services worldwide |

## üîß TECHNICAL CHANGES

### 1. Database Migration
```sql
-- Renamed old column (backup)
ALTER TABLE listings RENAME COLUMN region TO region_old;

-- Added new array column
ALTER TABLE listings ADD COLUMN region text[];

-- Migrated existing data
UPDATE listings 
SET region = ARRAY[region_old]
WHERE region_old IS NOT NULL;

-- Set empty arrays for NULL values
UPDATE listings 
SET region = ARRAY[]::text[]
WHERE region IS NULL;

-- Dropped old column
ALTER TABLE listings DROP COLUMN region_old;
```

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ 268 total listings migrated
- ‚úÖ 15 had old region data (converted to arrays)
- ‚úÖ 253 had NULL (now empty arrays)
- ‚úÖ 265 Live listings unaffected

### 2. TypeScript Schema
```typescript
// Updated schema
region: z.array(z.string()).optional()

// Updated type
region: string[] | null;
```

### 3. Submit Form UI
**Changed from:**
```typescript
<Select value={formData.region}>
  <SelectItem value="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</SelectItem>
</Select>
```

**Changed to:**
```typescript
<Checkbox 
  checked={formData.region.includes("West Coast")}
  onCheckedChange={(checked) => {
    // Add or remove from array
  }}
/>
```

### 4. Filter Logic
**Changed from:**
```typescript
query.eq("region", params.region)
```

**Changed to:**
```typescript
query.contains("region", [params.region])
// Uses PostgreSQL array contains operator @>
```
