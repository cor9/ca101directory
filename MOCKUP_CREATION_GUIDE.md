# How to Create Listing Mockups for Soft Close Pitch

## Quick Method: Edit + Screenshot Workflow

### Tools Needed:
- Admin access to dashboard
- Screenshot tool (built-in on Mac/Windows, or use Chrome extension)
- Image from vendor's website/Instagram (optional)

---

## Step-by-Step Process (15 mins per mockup):

### 1. **Capture the BEFORE screenshot**
   ```
   Visit: https://directory.childactor101.com/listing/{vendor-slug}
   Take full-page screenshot
   Save as: vendor-name-BEFORE.png
   ```

### 2. **Edit the listing as admin**

   **Go to:** `/dashboard/admin/edit/{listing-id}`

   **Enhancements to make:**

   ✅ **Profile Image:**
   - Find their logo on their website
   - Or use their Instagram profile pic
   - Upload to listing

   ✅ **Gallery Images (4 photos):**
   - Grab from their Instagram
   - Or their website gallery
   - Upload to listing gallery

   ✅ **Rewrite Description:**

   **Before:**
   ```
   "We offer headshot photography for actors."
   ```

   **After:**
   ```
   "Award-winning headshot photography that books roles.

   Specializing in child actors ages 8-17, we create authentic,
   casting-ready headshots that capture your child's unique personality.

   Over 200 young actors have booked their first role using our headshots.

   What makes us different:
   • 10+ years photographing young talent
   • Fast turnaround (48 hours)
   • Unlimited outfit changes
   • Casting director approved

   Perfect for: First-time actors, seasoned performers,
   and families preparing for pilot season."
   ```

   ✅ **Add/Improve Categories:**
   - Add secondary categories they might serve
   - Example: "Headshot Photography" + "Acting Coaches" if they also coach

   ✅ **Add Social Media Links:**
   - Instagram, Facebook, Website

   ✅ **Upgrade Plan to "Pro":**
   - Temporarily change plan dropdown to "Pro"
   - This enables featured placement

### 3. **Save (but don't approve yet)**

   - Click "Save"
   - Leave status as "Pending" or "Draft"
   - This way it won't go live yet

### 4. **Capture the AFTER screenshot**

   ```
   Visit: https://directory.childactor101.com/listing/{vendor-slug}

   If it's not showing (because status is Pending):
   - Temporarily change status to "Live"
   - Take screenshot
   - Change back to "Pending"

   Save as: vendor-name-AFTER.png
   ```

### 5. **Create side-by-side comparison**

   **Option A: Use Canva (Free)**
   - Go to Canva.com
   - Create new design (1200x800px)
   - Upload both screenshots
   - Place side-by-side with labels "BEFORE" and "AFTER"
   - Add arrow showing transformation
   - Download as PNG

   **Option B: Simple email approach**
   - Attach both images to email
   - Write: "BEFORE: Your current listing" above first image
   - Write: "AFTER: What you'll get with Pro" above second image

### 6. **Revert or Keep**

   **If they say YES:**
   - Change status to "Live"
   - Listing is already upgraded!
   - They just need to pay

   **If they say NO/ghost:**
   - Delete the images you added
   - Revert description to original
   - Change plan back to "Free"
   - Save

## Time-Saving Tips:

### Batch Creation:
1. Do 5-10 mockups in one sitting
2. Use same template language for descriptions (just swap details)
3. Keep a folder of stock images for common categories

## Pro Tip: The "Live Preview" Trick

Instead of screenshots, you can send them a LIVE preview link:

1. Create the enhanced listing
2. Keep it as "Pending" status
3. Add a preview parameter to URL:
   ```
   https://directory.childactor101.com/listing/{slug}?admin_preview=true
   ```
4. Send them the link: "Here's a live preview of your upgraded listing"

**Note:** You'll need to add this preview feature to the listing page code.

## What to Include in the Mockup Email:

```
Subject: Here's your upgraded listing (preview)

Hi [Name],

I put together a quick mockup of what your listing would look like
with the Pro upgrade:

[ATTACH: side-by-side comparison image]

The key differences:

✅ Professional photos (logo + gallery)
✅ Featured placement (top of search results)
✅ Optimized description that converts browsers into bookers
✅ Full social media integration

Your current free listing has gotten [X] views this month.

With featured placement + photos, expect 3-5x more visibility
and direct parent inquiries.

Want me to push this live with Founding Pro pricing ($199/6mo)?

Let me know!

## Automation Idea (Future):

Build a "Mockup Generator" tool in admin dashboard:

1. Select listing
2. Click "Generate Mockup"
3. AI rewrites description
4. Pulls images from their website automatically
5. Generates before/after comparison
6. Sends email automatically

For now, manual process takes 10-15 mins per vendor.

## Tracking Your Outreach:

Create a simple spreadsheet:

| Vendor Name | Email | Mockup Sent | Response | Status | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------------|----------|--------|-------|
| ABC Studio | abc@... | 11/29 | Interested | Follow-up | Wants to see gallery examples |
| XYZ Photos | xyz@... | 11/29 | No response | Pending | Send reminder 12/2 |

Or use the Hot Leads dashboard notes feature (if we add it).
