Subject: Quick question about your Child Actor 101 listing

Hi [NAME],

I noticed your listing for [BUSINESS NAME] on Child Actor 101 — and saw you've gotten [X] parent views in the last week!

That tells me parents in [CITY] are actively searching for [their specialty] and finding you.

Quick question: What kind of parents are your best fit?
(Age range? Experience level? Specific goals?)

I'm working with a small group of founding vendors to optimize their listings before we open the floodgates, and I'd love to help tune yours up.

No catch — just want to make sure you're set up to capture those parent inquiries.

Let me know if you're open to a quick listing review?

Best,
Corey
