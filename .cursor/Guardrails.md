## Contrast Rules (Permanent)
- Never use dark text on dark backgrounds.
- On navy or charcoal backgrounds, header and body text must use light tokens: `text-paper` or `text-foreground`.
- On cream or other light surfaces, use dark ink: `text-ink` or `text-surface`.
- Before merging, visually verify `/category`, `/directory`, and headers for contrast.
