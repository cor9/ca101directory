## 🧪 **STEP 2: SMOKE TESTS** ⏰ 15 min

Run these tests **in order** using your production URL:

### **Test 1: Registration Flow (2 min)** 
```
☐ Open incognito window
☐ Go to /auth/register

☐ Submit
☐ Should see success message: "Changes will be reviewed"
☐ Listing status should change to "Pending"
```

**Expected Result:** ✅ Status changes to Pending for review

**If it fails:** Check submit-supabase.ts status logic

---

### **Test 6: New Paid Submission (2 min)**
```
☐ Go to /submit
☐ Select "Pro Plan" or "Premium Plan"

```

**Expected Result:** ✅ Free submissions require review

**If it fails:** Check submit-supabase.ts status logic

---

## 🔍 **STEP 3: DATABASE HEALTH CHECK** ⏰ 2 min

Run these queries in **Supabase SQL Editor**:

### **Query 1: Check for Orphaned Users**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as orphaned_users
FROM auth.users u
LEFT JOIN profiles p ON u.id = p.id
WHERE p.id IS NULL;
```

**Expected:** `0` (zero orphaned users)  
**If > 0:** Trigger is broken or fallback didn't work

---

### **Query 2: Profile Integrity Check**
```sql
SELECT * FROM verify_profile_integrity();
```

**Expected:** `0 rows` (no integrity issues)  
**If returns rows:** Some profiles are corrupted, needs manual fix

---

### **Query 3: Recent Registration Success Rate**
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_registrations,
  SUM(CASE WHEN email_confirmed_at IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as confirmed,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN email_confirmed_at IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as confirmation_rate
FROM auth.users
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```

**Expected:** Confirmation rate > 85%  
**If < 70%:** Email delivery issues or users not seeing confirmation page

---

### **Query 4: Recent Claims Activity**
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_claims,
  SUM(CASE WHEN approved = true THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as approved_claims
FROM claims
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```

**Expected:** Most/all claims approved (auto-approved now)  
**If low approval rate:** Check claim-listing.ts logic

---

## 📊 **SUCCESS METRICS TO MONITOR**

### **First 24 Hours:**
```
✅ Email confirmation rate: Should be >95%
✅ Profile creation failures: Should be 0%
✅ Successful claims: Should be ~100%
✅ Edit submissions: Should all go to "Pending"
✅ New paid submissions: Should go "Live" immediately
✅ Support tickets about auth: Should drop 80-90%
```

### **Red Flags (Immediate Action Required):**
```
🚨 Orphaned users count > 0
🚨 Email confirmation rate < 80%
🚨 Multiple "can't claim" reports
🚨 Profile creation errors in logs
🚨 Status not changing correctly on edits
```

---

## 🎯 **WHAT TO DO IF TESTS FAIL**

### **Registration Issues:**
1. Check Supabase Auth logs: Dashboard → Auth → Logs
2. Check SMTP settings: Dashboard → Auth → Email
3. Verify redirect URLs include `/auth/registration-success`
4. Test email delivery with a known good email address

### **Claim Issues:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check Supabase RLS policies: `profiles` and `listings` tables
3. Verify user has `vendor` role in profiles table
4. Check claim-listing.ts server logs

### **Email Confirmation Issues:**
1. Check spam folder (obvious but often the issue)
2. Verify SMTP credentials in Supabase
3. Check email template includes `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}`
4. Test resend functionality

### **Status Logic Issues:**
1. Check submit-supabase.ts status logic (lines 120-121 and 170-171)
2. Verify plan value is exactly "Free" or "free" (case sensitive)
3. Check database - query listing status directly
4. Look at success message - does it match expected status?
