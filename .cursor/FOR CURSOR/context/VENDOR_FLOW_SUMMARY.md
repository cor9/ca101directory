## ⚠️ MAIN PROBLEMS

### 1. DIANE'S SITUATION (Representative of Many Users)
- Her listing exists (Free plan)
- She's NOT registered
- Tried to claim → ❌ Blocked (needs account)
- Tried to upload images → ❌ Gallery disabled (Free plan)
- **Thinks system is broken**

### 2. FREE PLAN ORPHANS
- 262 unclaimed Free listings
- Most vendors never registered
- Can't claim without creating account
- No automated way to link them

### 3. CONFUSING PLAN RESTRICTIONS
- Free users see gallery upload (disabled)
- No "Upgrade to unlock" messaging
- Appears broken, not gated
- Upgrade path unclear

### 4. PAID USERS STILL WAIT
- They paid money
- Still go to "Pending" status
- Wait for admin review
- No instant gratification

## 💡 KEY QUESTIONS TO ANSWER

### Question 1: Registration Strategy
**Should Free submissions require account?**
- YES: All submissions get owner from day 1
- NO: Lower barrier to entry, claim later

### Question 2: Auto-Publish Strategy
**Should Paid listings skip admin review?**
- YES: Instant Live (they paid for it!)
- NO: Maintain quality control on all

### Question 3: Free Plan Strategy
**What's the Free plan purpose?**
- Lead generation → Upsell to Pro?
- Community service → Free forever?
- Trial period → Upgrade required?

### Question 4: Gallery Upload Strategy  
**How to handle Free users wanting galleries?**
- Hard block with "Upgrade Now" button?
- Allow upload, don't show until upgraded?
- Show locked gallery with preview of Pro?

### Question 5: Unclaimed Listings
**265 unclaimed Free listings - what to do?**
- Email blast: "Claim your listing!"
- Auto-expire after 90 days?
- Admin manually converts to claimed?
- Keep as-is (vendor discovery)?
