# FOR CURSOR - Child Actor 101 Directory Progress Log

## 🚨 **CURRENT ISSUE - VERCELL 404 ERROR TROUBLESHOOTING**

### ⚠️ **ACTIVE PROBLEM (Latest Session)**

**🔍 VERCELL 404 ERROR - INVESTIGATING ROOT CAUSE**
- ❌ **Both domains returning 404** - `ca101-directory.vercel.app` and `directory.childactor101.com`
- ❌ **Deployment shows "Ready"** - But app not serving content
- ❌ **Build successful** - All routes built correctly in logs
- ❌ **Environment variables configured** - All required vars present
- ❌ **Custom domain assigned** - Properly configured in Vercel

**🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING ATTEMPTS MADE:**
- ✅ **Domain transfer** - Moved from wrong project to `ca101-directory`
- ✅ **Environment variables** - Added all required vars to production
- ✅ **Middleware disabled** - Ruled out as cause of 404
- ✅ **CNAME file added** - `public/CNAME` with custom domain
- ✅ **Layout auth fix** - Made auth call resilient to prevent crashes
- ✅ **Minimal homepage** - Simplified to basic "Hello World" test

**🎯 CURRENT STATUS:**
- **Deployment**: ✅ Successful (shows "Ready" in Vercel)
- **Build**: ✅ Successful (all routes built)
- **Domain**: ✅ Configured (assigned to correct project)
- **Environment**: ✅ All variables present
- **App**: ❌ Still returning 404 on all routes

### 🎯 **CURRENT STATUS - DEBUGGING DEPLOYMENT**

**BUILD STATUS:** ✅ **COMPLETELY SUCCESSFUL!**
- ✅ **All Sanity dependencies eliminated** from core functionality
- ✅ **Dynamic route generation working** for categories and tags
- ✅ **Airtable integration functional** for data fetching
- ✅ **Type compatibility resolved** - All components use custom ItemInfo type
- ❌ **Vercel deployment issue** - App not serving despite successful build
- ✅ **Local development working** - Server running at localhost:3000

**REPOSITORY STATUS:**
- **GitHub**: `https://github.com/cor9/ca101directory`
- **Latest Commit**: Minimal homepage for debugging 404 issue
- **Build Errors**: **ZERO** - All issues resolved
- **Deployment**: **404 ERROR** - Investigating root cause

### 🔍 **CURRENT INVESTIGATION**

**POSSIBLE CAUSES:**
1. **App initialization failure** - Something preventing app from starting
2. **Environment variable issue** - Missing or incorrect vars
3. **Domain configuration** - DNS or Vercel domain settings
4. **Next.js routing issue** - App Router configuration problem
5. **Middleware conflict** - Despite being disabled

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. **Check Vercel deployment logs** - Look for runtime errors
2. **Test with minimal app** - Strip down to bare minimum
3. **Verify environment variables** - Ensure all are correctly set
4. **Check domain DNS** - Verify proper resolution

### 🎭 **WHAT SHOULD BE WORKING**

**Parents should be able to:**
- ✅ Browse the homepage with clean design
- ✅ Search for acting professionals
- ✅ Filter by categories (Acting Coaches, Photographers, etc.)
- ✅ Filter by age ranges (tags)
- ✅ View detailed professional listings
- ✅ See contact information and websites

**Vendors should be able to:**
- ✅ View pricing plans
- ✅ See authentication options
- ✅ Understand the directory structure

### 🔧 **TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS**

**Sanity → Airtable Migration:**
- ✅ **Custom ItemInfo type** - No Sanity dependency
- ✅ **Airtable data layer** - Complete integration
- ✅ **Dynamic route generation** - Working with Airtable data
- ✅ **Error handling** - Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- ✅ **Type safety** - Custom types for Airtable integration

**Authentication System:**
- ✅ **Google OAuth** - Configured and working
- ✅ **Facebook OAuth** - Configured and working  
- ✅ **Email/Password** - Basic implementation
- ✅ **NextAuth.js** - Properly configured
- ✅ **Security** - Environment variables protected

### 🎯 **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY - FIX 404 ERROR**

**Critical Issue:**
- **Problem**: Both Vercel domains returning 404 despite successful build
- **Impact**: Directory not accessible to users
- **Status**: Actively investigating root cause
- **Next**: Check deployment logs and test minimal app

**Debugging Strategy:**
1. **Minimal test page** - Strip to bare minimum
2. **Check runtime logs** - Look for initialization errors
3. **Verify environment** - Ensure all vars correct
4. **Test domain resolution** - Check DNS and Vercel config
