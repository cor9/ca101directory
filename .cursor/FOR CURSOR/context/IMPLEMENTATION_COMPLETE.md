   - Password: Resend API key
   - Sender email: `noreply@childactor101.com`

### ✅ PHASE 5: TESTING (READY)

**Test Scenarios Prepared:**
1. New user registration → Registration success page → Email confirmation
2. Claim flow (happy path) → Instant claim → Dashboard redirect

   - Wrong role → Vendor requirement message
4. Edge cases:
   - Profile creation failure → Fallback logic
   - Email confirmation expired → Resend available
   - Duplicate registration → Helpful error message

**Monitoring Queries Available:**
```sql
-- Check for orphaned users
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM auth.users u
LEFT JOIN profiles p ON u.id = p.id
WHERE p.id IS NULL;

-- Check confirmation rate
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total,
  SUM(CASE WHEN email_confirmed_at IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as confirmed,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN email_confirmed_at IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as rate
FROM auth.users
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

-- Check profile integrity
SELECT * FROM verify_profile_integrity();
```
