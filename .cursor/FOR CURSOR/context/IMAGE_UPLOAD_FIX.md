# Image Upload Fix - Diane Christiansen Issue

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Issue:** Users unable to upload images  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

---

## üö® PROBLEM

Diane Christiansen (and likely others) unable to upload images when editing their listings.

---

## üîç ROOT CAUSES

### Issue #1: Missing Storage RLS Policies
**Storage bucket:** `listing-images`  
**RLS Status:** Enabled but NO POLICIES  
**Result:** All uploads blocked by default

The `listing-images` bucket had RLS enabled but no policies allowing authenticated users to upload files.

### Issue #2: File Type Mismatch
**Frontend accepts:** JPEG, PNG, WebP  
**API route accepts:** JPEG, PNG only  
**Result:** WebP uploads rejected with confusing error

### Issue #3: No Bucket Configuration
**Buckets had:**
- No file size limits set
- No MIME type restrictions
**Result:** Inconsistent validation, potential abuse

---

## ‚úÖ FIXES APPLIED

### 1. Created Storage RLS Policies

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload listing images"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'listing-images');

-- Allow authenticated users to update
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can update listing images"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'listing-images');

-- Allow everyone to view (public bucket)
CREATE POLICY "Public can view listing images"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'listing-images');

-- Allow authenticated users to delete
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can delete listing images"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'listing-images');
```

### 2. Fixed File Type Validation

**File:** `src/app/api/upload/route.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
// ‚ùå Only accepted JPEG and PNG
if (!file.type.match(/^image\/(jpeg|jpg|png)$/)) {
  return Response.json(
    { error: "Only JPEG and PNG images are allowed" },
    { status: 400 }
  );
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Now accepts JPEG, PNG, and WebP
if (!file.type.match(/^image\/(jpeg|jpg|png|webp)$/)) {
  return Response.json(
    { error: "Only JPEG, PNG, and WebP images are allowed" },
    { status: 400 }
  );
}
```

### 3. Added File Extension Handling

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Properly handles WebP extension
const fileExtension = 
  file.type === "image/jpeg" ? "jpg" : 
  file.type === "image/webp" ? "webp" : 
  "png";
```

### 4. Configured Storage Buckets

```sql
-- listing-images bucket
UPDATE storage.buckets
SET 
  file_size_limit = 5242880, -- 5MB
  allowed_mime_types = ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png', 'image/webp']
WHERE name = 'listing-images';

-- category_icons bucket
UPDATE storage.buckets
SET 
  file_size_limit = 2097152, -- 2MB
  allowed_mime_types = ARRAY['image/png', 'image/svg+xml', 'image/webp']
WHERE name = 'category_icons';
```

## üìä STORAGE CONFIGURATION

| Bucket | Public | Size Limit | Allowed Types |
|--------|--------|------------|---------------|
| listing-images | ‚úÖ Yes | 5 MB | JPEG, PNG, WebP |
| category_icons | ‚úÖ Yes | 2 MB | PNG, SVG, WebP |
| Attachments | ‚úÖ Yes | 1 MB | JPEG, PNG, SVG, WebP |

---

## üîí STORAGE SECURITY POLICIES

| Bucket | Action | Who | Policy |
|--------|--------|-----|--------|
| listing-images | Upload | Authenticated | ‚úÖ Allowed |
| listing-images | View | Everyone | ‚úÖ Allowed |
| listing-images | Update | Authenticated | ‚úÖ Allowed |
| listing-images | Delete | Authenticated | ‚úÖ Allowed |
| category_icons | Upload | Everyone | ‚úÖ Allowed |
| category_icons | View | Everyone | ‚úÖ Allowed |
| Attachments | Upload | Authenticated | ‚úÖ Allowed |

**Total Storage Policies:** 7 policies across 3 buckets

---

## ‚úÖ VERIFICATION

### Test Suite Results:

```sql
-- All policies created
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'storage';
-- Result: 7 ‚úÖ

-- All buckets configured
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM storage.buckets 
WHERE file_size_limit IS NOT NULL;
-- Result: 3 ‚úÖ
```

## üß™ TESTING SCENARIOS

### Test 1: Upload Profile Image (JPEG)
1. User on edit page
2. Uploads JPEG image (< 5MB)
3. ‚úÖ Should succeed

### Test 2: Upload Profile Image (PNG)
1. User on edit page
2. Uploads PNG image (< 5MB)
3. ‚úÖ Should succeed

### Test 3: Upload Profile Image (WebP)
1. User on edit page
2. Uploads WebP image (< 5MB)
3. ‚úÖ Should succeed (now supported!)

### Test 4: Upload Large File
1. User uploads 6MB image
2. ‚ùå Should fail with "File must be under 5MB"

### Test 5: Upload Wrong Type
1. User uploads GIF or BMP
2. ‚ùå Should fail with "Only JPEG, PNG, and WebP images are allowed"

### Test 6: Gallery Images
1. User uploads multiple images
2. Each goes through same validation
3. ‚úÖ All should succeed (up to plan limit)

## üõ°Ô∏è MONITORING

### Weekly Check (Run on 11th of each month):

```sql
-- Check storage policy count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'storage';
-- Expected: 7

-- Check bucket configuration
SELECT name, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types 
FROM storage.buckets;
-- All should have limits set
```

- ‚ùå No storage policies (uploads blocked)
- ‚ùå WebP not supported
- ‚ùå No bucket limits
- ‚ùå Diane couldn't upload images

**After:**
- ‚úÖ Complete storage policies
- ‚úÖ WebP fully supported
