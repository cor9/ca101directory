### üîí MANDATORY WORKFLOW FOR VERCELL OPERATIONS

**Before ANY Vercel command:**
1. **ALWAYS** run `vercel projects list` first
2. **ALWAYS** verify the correct project name
3. **ALWAYS** confirm with user before destructive operations
4. **NEVER** assume project names or IDs

**Project Information:**
- **Project Name**: `ca101-directory` (NOT `ca101directory`)
- **Domain**: `directory.childactor101.com`
- **Repository**: `cor9/ca101directory`

3. **IMMEDIATELY** link repository: `vercel link --yes`
4. **IMMEDIATELY** reattach domain: `vercel domains add directory.childactor101.com`
5. **IMMEDIATELY** redeploy: `vercel deploy`
