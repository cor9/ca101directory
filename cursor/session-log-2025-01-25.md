# Cursor Session Log - January 25, 2025

## Session Summary
Fixed critical email sending issues, implemented "Resend Claim Email" functionality, and created vendor import templates for bulk free listing management.

---

## üêõ Critical Fixes

### 1. Email Sending Failure - `RESEND_EMAIL_FROM` Invalid
**Problem:** "Listing Live" emails not sending due to invalid `RESEND_EMAIL_FROM` environment variable
**Root Cause:** Environment variable contained embedded newline character: `"noreply@childactor101.com\n"`
**Solution:**
- Removed corrupted env var from all environments (production, preview, development)
- Re-added cleanly using `printf` to avoid newline: `printf 'corey@childactor101.com' | vercel env add RESEND_EMAIL_FROM production`
- Updated FROM address from `noreply@` to `corey@childactor101.com` per user request
**Files:** Vercel environment variables
**Commits:**
- `a003506a` - Update RESEND_EMAIL_FROM to corey@childactor101.com
- `540df6e3` - Redeploy after fixing embedded newline

### 2. "Resend Claim Email" Button Missing
**Problem:** Button only showed for Pending listings, not all listings
**Solution:**
- Modified `ListingActions` component to accept `showApproveReject` prop
- Updated admin listings page to show "Resend" button for ALL listings
- Approve/Reject buttons conditionally shown only for Pending status
**Files:**
- `src/components/admin/listing-actions.tsx`
- `src/app/(website)/(protected)/dashboard/admin/listings/page.tsx`
**Commit:** `1130d7b5` - Add Resend Claim Email button for all listings

- **With email addresses:** 19 (7%)
- **Missing email addresses:** 248 (93%)

**Action Item:** User using LLM agents to find emails for 248 vendors via web scraping

- ‚úÖ Database uses 10 broad regions (West Coast, Midwest, etc.)
- Updated all documentation to match database reality

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate (User in Progress)
1. ‚úÖ Use LLM agent to scrape emails for 248 free listings
2. ‚è≥ Populate Google Sheets template with scraped data
3. ‚è≥ Validate data (categories, regions, format)
4. ‚è≥ Upload CSV via admin dashboard
5. ‚è≥ Bulk send "Listing Live" emails to all new vendors

### Future Enhancements (Discussed but Not Implemented)
- [ ] Make email field required in bulk upload validation
- [ ] Add CSV category dropdown validation (currently free-text with note)
- [ ] Auto-send emails to vendors when their listings go Live
- [ ] Track email open rates via Resend webhooks

## üí° Key Learnings

1. **Environment Variables:** Always verify env vars with `od -c` to catch invisible characters (newlines, spaces)
2. **Email Validation:** Resend fails silently with invalid FROM addresses - check logs
3. **Data Validation:** LLM agents need exact matching rules and comprehensive examples
4. **Regional Mapping:** Always verify database reality vs. code assumptions
5. **User Workflow:** Bulk operations need clear templates, validation, and error reporting

---

‚úÖ **Email system fully operational**
‚úÖ **Admin can resend claim emails to any vendor**
‚úÖ **Comprehensive vendor import system in place**
‚úÖ **LLM agent instructions ready for bulk data collection**
‚úÖ **All payment links documented and verified**
