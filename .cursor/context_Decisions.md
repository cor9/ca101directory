## 2025-10-27 ‚Äî STRIPE PRICING TABLE WEBHOOK FIX (COMPLETE)

### Problem
Jennifer Boyce (and potentially other vendors) was getting "Oops something went wrong at checkout" when trying to purchase a plan through the Stripe Pricing Table on `/plan-selection`. The issue had two parts:
1. **Missing Stripe Dashboard Configuration** - Success/Cancel URLs weren't configured
2. **Webhook Can't Process Pricing Table Checkouts** - The webhook expected metadata that Stripe Pricing Tables don't automatically provide

### Root Causes:
1. **Stripe Pricing Table Configuration** - The embedded pricing table (`prctbl_1SCpyNBqTvwy9ZuSNiSGY03P`) didn't have success/cancel URLs configured in Stripe Dashboard
2. **Webhook Metadata Requirements** - The webhook at `src/app/api/webhook/route.ts` expected `vendor_id`, `listing_id`, and `plan` in session metadata, but Stripe Pricing Tables only provide `client-reference-id` and custom metadata attributes
3. **Plan Detection** - No logic to determine which plan (Standard/Pro, monthly/yearly) was purchased from the Stripe session

### Solution Implemented:

#### 1. STRIPE DASHBOARD CONFIGURATION (Manual)
**Set in Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Pricing Tables:**
- **Success URL:** `https://directory.childactor101.com/payment-success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`
- **Cancel URL:** `https://directory.childactor101.com/plan-selection?listingId={CLIENT_REFERENCE_ID}&error=Payment%20was%20cancelled`

#### 2. ENHANCED WEBHOOK HANDLING (`src/app/api/webhook/route.ts`)

**Pricing Table Detection & Metadata Extraction:**
```typescript
// Extract listing_id from client_reference_id (Pricing Table standard)
if (!listingId && session.client_reference_id) {
  listingId = session.client_reference_id;
}

// Detect plan from Stripe line items
const lineItems = await stripe.checkout.sessions.listLineItems(session.id, { limit: 1 });
const priceAmount = firstItem.price.unit_amount;

// Determine plan based on price
// Standard: $25/month ($2500) or $250/year ($25000)
// Pro: $50/month ($5000) or $500/year ($50000)
if (priceAmount === 2500 || priceAmount === 25000) {
  plan = "Standard";
  billingCycle = priceAmount === 2500 ? "monthly" : "yearly";
} else if (priceAmount === 5000 || priceAmount === 50000) {
  plan = "Pro";
  billingCycle = priceAmount === 5000 ? "monthly" : "yearly";
}
```

**Vendor ID Resolution (3 Fallback Methods):**
1. Check `session.metadata.vendor_id` (from API checkouts)
2. Look up `listings.owner_id` by listing_id
3. Look up `users.id` by `session.customer_details.email`

**Comprehensive Logging:**
- Log all Pricing Table specific flows with `[Pricing Table]` prefix
- Log detected plan, billing cycle, and vendor resolution steps
- Clear error messages when vendor can't be determined

#### 3. ERROR BANNER ON PLAN SELECTION PAGE (`src/app/(website)/(public)/plan-selection/page.tsx`)
Added error state handling to display payment errors to users with support contact info.

### Files Changed:
- `src/app/api/webhook/route.ts` - Enhanced to handle Pricing Table checkouts
- `src/app/(website)/(public)/plan-selection/page.tsx` - Added error banner and logging
- Stripe Dashboard (manual) - Configured success/cancel URLs for pricing table

### Testing Steps:
1. ‚úÖ User navigates to `/plan-selection?listingId=<uuid>`
2. ‚úÖ User selects Standard or Pro plan from Stripe Pricing Table
3. ‚úÖ User completes payment through Stripe checkout
4. ‚úÖ Stripe redirects to `/payment-success?session_id=<id>`
5. ‚úÖ Webhook receives `checkout.session.completed` event
6. ‚úÖ Webhook detects plan from line items
7. ‚úÖ Webhook resolves vendor_id from listing or email
8. ‚úÖ Listing updated with plan and owner_id
9. ‚úÖ Vendor sees success message

### Business Impact:
- **Immediate:** Jennifer Boyce and other vendors can now complete checkout successfully
- **Revenue:** Unblocks all Stripe Pricing Table sales (primary payment flow)
- **Support:** Reduces "payment not working" support tickets
- **Reliability:** Robust fallback logic handles edge cases

## 2025-10-27 ‚Äî VENDOR TIER RESTRICTIONS ENFORCEMENT (COMPLETE)

### Problem
Vendors on Free tier could fill out premium fields (Who Is It For, What Makes You Unique, Social Media Links, Additional Notes) and upload images they weren't eligible for, causing confusion and potential abuse of the tier system.

### Issues Identified:
1. **No server-side validation** - Free tier users could submit premium content
2. **Confusing UX** - Fields were shown but disabled, appearing broken rather than gated
3. **No upgrade prompts** - Users didn't understand what they were missing
4. **Gallery uploads** - Free users could attempt uploads that wouldn't be saved
5. **Category limits** - Free tier should only allow 1 category, but multiple were possible

### Solution Implemented:

#### 1. SERVER-SIDE TIER ENFORCEMENT (`submit-supabase.ts`)
Added robust validation that strips premium content for Free tier:

**Free Tier Restrictions:**
- `who_is_it_for`: Set to NULL (Premium field - Standard/Pro only)
- `why_is_it_unique`: Set to NULL (Premium field - Standard/Pro only)
- `extras_notes`: Set to NULL (Premium field - Standard/Pro only)
- `categories`: Limited to 1 (Free gets 1, Paid gets multiple)
- `gallery`: Set to NULL (Free gets 0 images)
- Social media fields: All set to NULL (Pro only)
- `profile_image`: Allowed but not enforced (Standard/Pro feature)

**Standard Tier Gets:**
- Premium content fields (who_is_it_for, why_is_it_unique, extras_notes)
- Profile image (1)
- Multiple categories
- NO gallery images (Pro only)
- NO social media links (Pro only)

**Pro Tier Gets:**
- Everything Standard has, PLUS:
- Gallery images (up to 4)
- Social media links (all platforms)
- Custom link

#### 2. FRONTEND RESTRICTIONS & UPGRADE NUDGES (`supabase-submit-form.tsx`)

**Enhanced Field Disabling:**
- Premium fields show lock icon üîí when disabled
- Fields are visually dimmed with `opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed`
- Clear placeholders: "üîí Upgrade to Standard or Pro to use this field"

**Upgrade Nudge Messages Added:**

a) **Profile Image Section (Free tier)**
```
üì∏ Stand Out with a Professional Image
Free listings don't include images. Upgrade to Standard ($25/mo) or
Pro ($50/mo) to add a professional profile photo that makes your listing
3x more likely to be clicked!
[View Upgrade Options ‚Üí]
```

b) **Gallery Images Section (Free/Standard tier)**
```
üñºÔ∏è Showcase Your Work with Gallery Images
Upgrade to Pro ($50/mo) to showcase up to 4 additional photos of your
work, studio, or team!
[Upgrade to Pro ‚Üí] [See Examples]
```

c) **Premium Content Fields**
Each field shows orange warning box:
```
Premium Field: This field is only available with Standard ($25/mo)
or Pro ($50/mo) plans. [View plans]
```

d) **Social Media Section (Free/Standard tier)**
```
üîí Pro Plan Only
Pro Feature: Social media links are exclusive to Pro plan members.
Upgrade to Pro to showcase your Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube,
LinkedIn, and custom links. [View Pro plan]
```

e) **Categories Section (Free tier)**
```
Categories (Select 1 - Free Plan)
Free Plan: You can select 1 category. Upgrade to Standard or Pro
to select multiple categories.
```

**Plan Selection Feedback:**
- **Free Plan**: Shows warning with list of locked features
- **Standard Plan**: Shows what's included + nudge to Pro for gallery/social
- **Pro Plan**: Celebrates choice and lists all premium features

#### 3. VISUAL IMPROVEMENTS
- Gradient backgrounds on upgrade prompts (blue, purple, orange themed)
- Emoji icons for visual appeal (üì∏, üñºÔ∏è, üîí, ‚≠ê, ‚úÖ)
- Clear CTAs with hover states
- Inline links to pricing page and help docs

### Files Modified:
1. `src/actions/submit-supabase.ts` - Server-side tier enforcement
2. `src/components/submit/supabase-submit-form.tsx` - Frontend restrictions + upgrade nudges
3. `.cursor/context_Decisions.md` - This documentation

### Tier Feature Matrix (Enforced):

| Feature | Free | Standard | Pro |
|---------|------|----------|-----|
| Basic Info | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Profile Image | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ (1) | ‚úÖ (1) |
| Gallery Images | ‚ùå (0) | ‚ùå (0) | ‚úÖ (4) |
| Premium Content Fields | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Categories | ‚úÖ (1) | ‚úÖ (Multiple) | ‚úÖ (Multiple) |
| Social Media Links | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Additional Notes | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |

### Business Impact:
- ‚úÖ Revenue protection: Free tier can't access premium features
- ‚úÖ Clear upgrade path: Users see exactly what they're missing
- ‚úÖ Improved UX: Locked features feel intentional, not broken
- ‚úÖ Conversion optimization: Multiple upgrade prompts throughout form
- ‚úÖ Data integrity: Server-side enforcement prevents abuse

### Prevention Rules:
- **ALWAYS enforce tier restrictions server-side** - Never trust client data
- **Make locked features aspirational** - Show what's possible with upgrade
- **Use positive framing** - "Upgrade to unlock" vs "You can't do this"
- **Multiple conversion points** - Upgrade prompts at every gated feature
- **Visual clarity** - Lock icons, dimmed fields, gradient backgrounds

## 2025-10-19 ‚Äî HELP PAGES TEXT CONTRAST FIX (COMPLETE)

### Problem
All help pages had invisible text due to using `text-gray-900` (dark text) on navy backgrounds, violating Bauhaus design system contrast rules.

### Solution Implemented
Fixed all help pages to use proper Bauhaus color tokens:
- Navy backgrounds ‚Üí `text-paper` (light text) for main content
- White/cream card backgrounds ‚Üí `text-ink` (dark text) for card content
- Applied proper contrast throughout all help pages

### Files Fixed:
- `src/app/(website)/(public)/help/page.tsx` - Main help center (already correct)
- `src/app/(website)/(public)/help/getting-started/page.tsx` - ‚úÖ Fixed
- `src/app/(website)/(public)/help/claim-listing/page.tsx` - ‚úÖ Fixed
- `src/app/(website)/(public)/help/editing-listing/page.tsx` - ‚úÖ Fixed
- `src/app/(website)/(public)/help/image-guidelines/page.tsx` - ‚úÖ Fixed
- `src/app/(website)/(public)/help/pricing-plans/page.tsx` - ‚úÖ Fixed
- `src/app/(website)/(public)/help/troubleshooting/page.tsx` - ‚úÖ Fixed
- `src/app/(website)/(public)/help/101-approved/page.tsx` - ‚úÖ Fixed
- `src/app/(website)/(public)/help/faq/page.tsx` - Already fixed (Oct 18)

### Design System Applied:
- **Navy backgrounds** (#0d1b2a) ‚Üí `text-paper` (#fafaf4) for headers and body
- **White/cream cards** ‚Üí `text-ink` (#0f1113) for all card content
- **Colored info boxes** (blue-50, yellow-50, etc.) ‚Üí `text-ink` for readability
- Maintained proper Bauhaus classes: `bauhaus-heading`, `bauhaus-body`, `bauhaus-card`

### Result:
All help pages now have proper text contrast and follow the established Bauhaus Mid-Century Modern Hollywood design system. No more invisible text on navy backgrounds.

## 2025-10-18 ‚Äî COMPREHENSIVE DESIGN SYSTEM FIX (CRITICAL)

### Problem
Previous agent added harmful global CSS overrides (lines 757-841 in globals.css) that broke the Bauhaus design system:
- Used `text-gray-900` (dark text) on navy backgrounds causing unreadable text
- Added blanket `!important` overrides that conflicted with design system
- Ignored established Bauhaus classes and color tokens
- Created contrast violations across 20+ pages

### Solution Implemented
1. **Removed ALL harmful global CSS overrides** (lines 757-841 in globals.css)
   - Deleted all `text-gray-900` forced overrides
   - Deleted all navigation forced color overrides
   - Deleted all card content forced overrides

2. **Fixed Core Pages with Proper Bauhaus Design System:**
   - `/submit` page - Navy bg with `text-paper` (light text)
   - `/pricing` page - Navy bg with `text-paper`, cream cards with `text-ink`
   - `/category` page - Navy bg with `text-paper`, cream cards with `text-ink`
   - `/category/[slug]` pages - Navy bg with `text-paper`
   - `/search` page - Navy bg with `text-paper`
   - `/help/faq` page - Navy bg with `text-paper`, cream cards with `text-ink`

3. **Applied Proper Bauhaus Classes:**
   - Headers: `bauhaus-heading` with `text-paper` on navy backgrounds
   - Body text: `bauhaus-body` with `text-paper` on navy backgrounds
   - Cards: `bauhaus-card` with `bg-surface` and `text-ink`/`text-surface`
   - Buttons: `bauhaus-btn-primary` and `bauhaus-btn-secondary`
   - Links: `text-secondary-denim` with `hover:text-bauhaus-blue`

### Design System Rules (MUST FOLLOW):
- **Navy backgrounds** (#0d1b2a) ‚Üí ALWAYS use `text-paper` (#fafaf4)
- **Cream/Surface backgrounds** (#fffdd0) ‚Üí ALWAYS use `text-ink` (#0f1113) or `text-surface` (#1f2327)
- **NEVER use `text-gray-900`** on navy backgrounds
- **NEVER use generic CSS overrides** - use Bauhaus classes
- **NEVER flood sections with cream** - use navy with cream cards

### Files Fixed:
- `src/styles/globals.css` - Removed harmful overrides
- `src/app/(website)/(public)/submit/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(website)/(public)/pricing/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(website)/(public)/category/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(website)/(public)/category/[slug]/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(website)/(public)/search/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(website)/(public)/help/faq/page.tsx`

### Prevention:
- Added explicit rules to Guardrails.md
- Documented in design.md
- This decision log serves as reference for future agents

## 2025-10-18 ‚Äî Category header contrast fix

- Problem: Dark text appeared on a navy background in `/category` header content.
- Decision: Use light text tokens on dark backgrounds across marketing pages.
- Implementation: Set container text to `text-paper` in `src/app/(website)/(public)/category/page.tsx` for header block. Added contrast rules to `Guardrails.md`.
- Rationale: Prevent recurrence and ensure AA/AAA readability.

## 2025-01-27 ‚Äî MAJOR DESIGN SYSTEM VIOLATIONS (URGENT FIX NEEDED)

### Problems Created:
1. **Ignored Bauhaus Design System**: Failed to read `.cursor/rules/design.md` and `.cursor/Guardrails.md` before making changes
2. **Wrong Text Colors**: Used `text-gray-900` on navy backgrounds instead of `text-paper`
3. **Wrong Text Colors**: Used `text-paper` on cream backgrounds instead of `text-ink`/`text-surface`
4. **Flooded Sections with Cream**: Applied cream backgrounds everywhere instead of using navy with cream cards
5. **Missing CSS Variables**: Added `--cream-ink` variable but didn't follow design system usage
6. **Generic CSS Overrides**: Added blanket CSS overrides instead of using proper Bauhaus classes

### Files Damaged:
- `src/app/(website)/(public)/submit/page.tsx` - Wrong text colors on navy background
- `src/app/(website)/(public)/pricing/page.tsx` - Wrong text colors on navy background
- `src/app/(website)/(public)/category/page.tsx` - Wrong text colors
- `src/styles/globals.css` - Added incorrect CSS overrides instead of following design system
- Multiple component files - Applied wrong text colors throughout

### Design System Violations:
- Used `text-gray-900` on navy backgrounds (should be `text-paper`)
- Used `text-paper` on cream backgrounds (should be `text-ink`/`text-surface`)
- Ignored `bauhaus-heading`, `bauhaus-body`, `bauhaus-card` classes
- Created full-width cream sections instead of navy with cream cards
- Added generic CSS overrides instead of using proper Bauhaus component system

### Impact:
- Live site with paying customers has unreadable text
- Violated established design system
- Created inconsistent styling across pages
- Failed to follow documented contrast rules

### Required Fixes:
1. Revert all text color changes to follow Bauhaus design system
2. Use navy backgrounds with `text-paper` for headers
3. Use cream cards with `text-ink`/`text-surface` for content
4. Apply proper `bauhaus-heading`, `bauhaus-body`, `bauhaus-card` classes
5. Remove generic CSS overrides
6. Follow "Never flood sections with cream" rule
7. Use proper Bauhaus grid and component system

## 2025-10-19 ‚Äî SANITY CMS CLEANUP (COMPLETE)

### Problem
Project was built from a template that included Sanity CMS files, but the project uses Supabase as its database. Sanity files were causing build errors and confusion:
- Build failures due to missing Sanity dependencies
- Import errors for deleted Sanity modules
- Unused CMS configuration files taking up space
- Mixed Sanity/Supabase code causing maintenance issues

### Solution Implemented
**Proactive Approach**: Instead of manually removing files one by one, implemented a clean separation:

1. **Added Sanity files to `.gitignore`**:
   - `sanity.types.ts`
   - `sanity.cli.ts`
   - `sanity.config.ts`
   - `sanity-typegen.json`
   - `src/sanity/` directory

2. **Removed problematic scripts directory**:
   - Deleted entire `scripts/` directory containing Sanity batch operations
   - Eliminated build errors from missing Sanity imports

3. **Reset to clean commit state**:
   - Reset to commit `bcf2e3d4` which had removed Sanity files but kept scripts
   - Removed remaining scripts directory
   - Added Sanity files to gitignore to prevent future issues

### Files Affected:
- `.gitignore` - Added Sanity file exclusions
- `scripts/` directory - Completely removed (17 files)
- Build configuration - Now clean and error-free

### Result:
- ‚úÖ Build now compiles successfully
- ‚úÖ No more Sanity-related import errors
- ‚úÖ Clean separation between unused CMS and active Supabase code
- ‚úÖ Future Sanity files will be automatically ignored
- ‚úÖ Project ready for deployment

### Key Learning:
**Be proactive, not reactive**: Instead of fixing build errors file by file, address the root cause (unused CMS files) with proper gitignore configuration. This prevents future issues and maintains a clean codebase.
