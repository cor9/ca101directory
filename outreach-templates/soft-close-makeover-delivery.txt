Subject: Here's your upgraded listing (preview)

Hi [NAME],

Based on what you told me about working with [their ideal client], I put together an upgraded version of your listing.

Here's what I changed:

✅ Added a professional header with your logo
✅ Rewrote your description to highlight [specific benefit they mentioned]
✅ Added a gallery showcasing [their best work/space]
✅ Optimized your categories for better search visibility
✅ Moved you to featured placement (top of search results)

**BEFORE:** [attach screenshot of current listing]
**AFTER:** [attach mockup/screenshot of enhanced listing]

The difference?

Parents searching for [service] in [city] now see YOU first — with professional photos and a compelling description.

Early data shows upgraded listings get 3-5x more parent inquiries.

Here's the thing:

I'm opening 25 founding vendor spots with locked-in pricing:
- **Founding Pro**: $199 every 6 months (normally $300)
- Includes everything in the "after" screenshot above
- Price locked forever — even when we raise rates

Want me to reserve one of the founding spots for you?

I can push your upgraded listing live today.

Let me know!

Corey

P.S. This is the same setup our top-performing vendors use. They're booking 2-3 new clients per month directly from the directory.
