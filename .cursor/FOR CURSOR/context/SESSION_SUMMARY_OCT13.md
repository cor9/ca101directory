## 🐛 Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. Payment Routing Bug (Sarah's Issue)
**Problem:** Users selecting Pro/Standard plans were sent to success page instead of payment.

**Fix:** Updated submit form routing:
```typescript
if (formData.plan === "Free") {
  router.push(`/submit/success?id=${result.listingId}`);
} else {
  router.push(`/payment/${result.listingId}`); // ✅ NOW CORRECT
}
```

### 2. Admin Dashboard Filter Bug
**Problem:** Clicking approve/reject on Pending listings would reload and show ALL listings.

**Fix:** Added persistent status filter tabs:
- All Listings
- Pending Review (stays active after actions)
- Live
- Rejected

### 3. Multiple Build Errors Fixed
- ✅ Fixed `getCurrentUser` → `currentUser`
- ✅ Fixed `references` → `industry_references` (database column name)
- ✅ Fixed server action Supabase client imports
- ✅ Fixed icon name `help` → `shieldCheck`
- ✅ Added `badge_approved` to Listing type

### 4. Pricing Information Errors
**Problem:** Help pages showed incorrect pricing (Premium $90 plan that doesn't exist).

**Fix:** Corrected ALL help pages to show:
- Free: $0 (no images)
- Standard: $25/month (1 profile image)
- Pro: $50/month (profile + 4 gallery images)

### 5. Pricing Page Stripe Tables
**Problem:** Stripe pricing table included "Free Vendor Listing" option.

**Fix:** 
- Removed first pricing table with Free option
- Kept custom Free plan card (routes to `/submit`)
- Restored Standard/Pro Stripe table
- Restored 101 Approved Badge add-on table

## ⚠️ Known Issues / Future Work

2. **Sarah's Payment** - Need to verify:
   - Did her payment succeed in Stripe?
   - Is her listing properly claimed?
   - Does she need manual database fix?

3. **Badge Image** - Need to upload actual `101approvedbadge.png` to `/public` folder

## 📞 Next Steps

2. Edit Stripe pricing table to remove Free option

## 2025-10-17 19:16:24 PDT
- Commit 9587a297: categories icon mapping and fallbacks
  - Category grid uses PNG icons from bucket `category_pngs` via `getCategoryIconsMap()` and `getCategoryIconUrl()`
  - Default bucket configurable with `NEXT_PUBLIC_CATEGORY_ICON_BUCKET` (defaults to `category_pngs`)
  - Listing detail header and listing cards fall back to category icon when free/unclaimed and missing `profile_image`
  - Broadened listing status filters to avoid false 404s (`Live`/`Published` + null `is_active` treated as public)
- Files: `src/app/(website)/(public)/category/page.tsx`, `src/components/listing/listing-images.tsx`, `src/components/listings/ListingCard.tsx`, `src/data/categories.ts`, `src/data/listings.ts`, `src/lib/image-urls.ts`
- Next: Verify icons appear on category page and as listing fallbacks; deploy when ready
